This is a tentative plan for getting the game up and running, but everything is just ideas and we can change stuff as we go 

-------------------------------

## I. Get Game working!  

#### A. Do basic outline to figure out structure
#### B. Get something working 
- no characters or equipment yet
- a few cards hardcoded in

#### C. Make unit tests now that something works 
- use this to make sure it continues working as expected throughout process
- make sure to keep adding unit tests as add more functionality

#### D. Add in equipment functionality

#### E. Set up database for cards and incorporate that into code (that way there can be multiple decks like base game, expansion, etc) - means can use SQL!

#### F. Add in characters
- probably the most tedious part of getting the game up and running
- can start small with a few
- can use database to keep track of which characters are allowed in which game mode (i.e. if some are Kingdom Wars only), but will still have to hardcode them all in

-------------------------------

## II. Set it up so game can be played remotely with people 
 - Maybe ask David Chatterton if we can use one of his servers?
 - Might need to be set up earlier for the database...

-------------------------------

## III. UI for game

-------------------------------

## IV. AI CPU for game
